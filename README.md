# PLANETS N' STUFF

# Description
This project taught how to use event listeners to interact with objects on the DOM.  
We were required to display planet cards on page load.  
Display planet image on hover.  
On click of the planet card all other cards were to disappear while the event target was enlarged.  
Needed to be able to exit the enlarged card and return to main page.
